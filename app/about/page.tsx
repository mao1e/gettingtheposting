                        Hi there! I enlisted in Jan 2021 as part of the JC batch and ORD&apos;d at the end of 2022. When I enlisted, I was sent to mono-armour and thought that I would be in Armour Infantry for the rest of my NS.
                        Yet, after BMT, I was posted to OCS where I joined the Army Wing. <br />
                        In another dramatic change, I was then posted to the Air Force Wing while I was in OCS and ended up commissioning as an Air Force Officer.
                        It didn&apos;t stop there! After commissioning I was posted to an Air Force Battalion as a Logistics Officer...There were many changes in my journey and I hope that through this initiative I can help parents and enlistees understand more the many paths their NS journey can take.
