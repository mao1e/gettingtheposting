            <p> Many NSFs want to know <a className='text-primary'>how many people get into OCS.</a> Here we will breakdown the number to give a rough estimation of the percentage of NSFs who make it there.</p>
            <p>
                Let&apos;s first calculate the total number of new NSF Officers each year.
            </p>
            <p>We will use 2022, the latest full year of officer graduations. Data is taken from mindef.gov

                Adding all those numbers up, the total number of officer graduates stands at 1242. However, this includes officers who are regulars. While they also have a selection process, they do not have the same criterias as that of NSFs. Since they are out of this scope, we will take them out.
                <br /> Let&apos;s set the number of regulars to be 1/5 of the total number of OCS graduates. This is because, the Air and MIDs Wings are close to about 50% regulars while the DIS Wing is 100% regulars. Army wings should be about less than 10% regulars.
                <br /> <a className="underline decoration-primary decoration-3 hover:decoration-4">So the Total NSF OCS graduates is 994.</a>
                <br /><br /> Now we have to find the total number of NSFs
                <br /> According to Dr Eng En Hanâ€™s statement here: around 10% of NSF cohort are new citizens, which number 3400. So the NSF cohort each year is 34000.
                <br></br>Lets ball park scdf and spf to be 20% of the total NSFs so <a className="underline decoration-primary decoration-3 hover:decoration-4">the number of SAF NSFs stands at 27200.</a>

                To get into OCS, you have to be the top 994/27200, the top <a className='text-primary'>3.66%</a>
